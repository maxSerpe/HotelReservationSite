# NodeReactTemplateSite
This project will serve as a template for my future react projects; all new coding approaches adopted will be added here.  

Currently it is based on the tutorial found here: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-your-first-mern-mongodb-express-js-react-js-and-node-js-stack-7e8b20463e66

Although it contains a somewhat unecessary "Employee" focus that will often be removed, it is a common central object present in most applications that can likely be refitted to other use cases. 

The stack is currently Node for backend logic, Mongo for Database (mongoose specifically?), Express for routing (although React has a Switch function I need to take a deeper look at, although it may become clear in later route creation), and React for front end (need to take a look at the react documentation, maybe a guide on how to make professional looking frontends).
